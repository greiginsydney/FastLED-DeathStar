# FastLED-DeathStar
My first FastLED project

This is a works in progress.

it contains example chases from a range of sources and at this stage I may have not yet fully attributed all authors.

- https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Multiple-Controller-Examples
- https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/DemoReel100
- https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/XYMatrix

... to which were added patterns, aminations and chases from:
